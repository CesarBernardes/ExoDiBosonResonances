How to fit signal shapes

Shapes are fitted with "shape.py"
Necessary inputs are:
- a tree with the signal events
- a file with initial values for the fit parameters


usage:
python shape.py -n njets -f file [-p]

-n njets:	1: monojet channel
		2: dijet channel
		3: both channels

-f file:	input to use, this can be a root file as produced by the treemaker or a directory with such root files. In the case of a directory, the script will loop over all root files in the directory.

-p :		If this option is set, no fit is performed, but plots are produced using the saved results from previous fits.


The root files are expected to have names as produced by the std production scripts such as:
treeEDBR_BulkG_WW_lvjj_c0p2_M1000_xww.root
The filename is used to deduce whether the the W or Z channel is being fit

When fitting the file
treeEDBR_BulkG_WW_lvjj_c0p2_M1000_xww.root
input parameters are read from
pars/inpars_BulkG_WW_lvjj_c0p2_M1000_xww_<njet>.config
and fit results are stored in 
pars/outpars_BulkG_WW_lvjj_c0p2_M1000_xww_<njet>.config and
plots/BulkG_WW_lvjj_c0p2_M1000_xww_<njet><category><scale>.eps

The "outpars..." files serve as input for the datacards.


Some notes:
Internally the script fits a matched and unmatched contribution even in 1-jet case, were our final shape is only the matched one.
The unmatched contribution is suppressed by filling all 1-jet events into the matched category and the unmatched contribution to the pdf is fixed in the input parameters to 0.1% of the full function.
This could possibly be improved by using a properly simplified function for the 1jet case, but I didn't get around to do that yet.

Fit convergence can be troublesome. Playing with the initial parameters can help with that.

When creating the datasets, the script applies the recommended selections. These may change and will have to be updated.

At the time of this writing, we use only the muons for the WW monojet channel

Final event selection for the 2jet channel may be out of date.



Code structre (in case you want to improve the script)
main:
parses the command line parameters and starts processing of each appropriate file

processSubsample:
executes the fit on one subsample (i.e. inputfile + njet-selection)
It will create a workspace that collects all relevant variables and pdfs, execute the fit and produce plots
Filling the workspace and plotting is handles by separate routines, outlined below:

defineVars:
create all the RooRealVars for the fit and import them into the workspace.
Read the starting values from the appropriate file

readTree:
read the input tree to fill the rooDataSet for the fit.
This function performs the final selection. (i.e. nsubj21 cut)

plot:
produces plots in linear and log scale for the matched and unmatched categories separately and combined.
If the draw style is unsatisfactory, it can be changed here.
