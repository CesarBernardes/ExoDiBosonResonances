Where are the trees?

For WW:

/afs/cern.ch/work/s/shuai/public/diboson/trees/productionv6: 
	date         : 20130307
	cmgtuple list: cmgTuple_07032013_CA8/
	EDBR tag     : edbr_vv_20130313
	updates      : *) use properly selected and cleaned AK5 jets for b-tagging veto (WW only)
				   *) lepton-jet cleaning radius cut corrected from 0.5 to 0.8
				   *) kinematic cuts for WW better tuned with respect to the HLT trigger thresholds.
				   *) sequence of the main cfg re-structured
/afs/cern.ch/work/s/shuai/public/diboson/trees/productionv6/AK7:
	date         : 20130307
	cmgtuple     : cmgTuple_07032013_AK7
	updates      : (from previous) change only CA8 to AK7 in jet_cff.py

/afs/cern.ch/work/s/shuai/public/diboson/trees/productionv6/goodbtag/AK7:
	data         : 20130308
	cmgtuple     : cmgTuple_08032013_AK7
	updates      : (from previous) corrected lepton cleaning, so the b tagging is right. Change mu eta<2.1
