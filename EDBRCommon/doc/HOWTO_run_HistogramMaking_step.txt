Instructions for making plots from the plain ROOT TTrees

=== GENERAL COMMENTS ===

*) The basic idea is to present the user a class,
EDBRHistoMaker, which analyzes a given TTree or TChain
and produces a set of histograms which are then saved
in a ROOT file. 

*) The code is structured as a macro, divided in two files:
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/rootmacros/makeHisto.h and
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/rootmacros/makeHisto.C.

*) makeHisto.h file has the following itens:
   *) the structure of histograms which are created (numbers and edges of bins)
   *) the structure of the TTree analyzed (the list of variables, TBranches, 
   and the code to connect the TBranches)
   *) the declaration of the functions for analysis - for instance, there's a
   member function bool eventPassesCut(), which relies on the member variables
    

*) makeHisto.C file has the following itens
   *) the definition of the regions (signal/sideband, electron/muon, etc.)
   *) the definition of the functions for analysis
   *) more importantly, the definition of the Loop() function, which runs
   over the events on the TTree/TChain and fills the histograms

=== RUNNING ===

1) Start ROOT, with the file you want to analyze:

$ root -l inputFile.root

2) Load the macro:

[] .L makeHisto.C+

3) Create an object to run on the Tree:

EDBRHistoMaker* h = new EDBRHistoMaker(SelectedCandidates)

4) Run over the events and save the resulting histograms in a file.

h->Loop("results.root")

Naturally, we should update the code to create the histograms we actually want.
What is in place now is just a working example.
