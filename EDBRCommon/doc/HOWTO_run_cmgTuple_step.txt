Instructions for running the second step of the analysis:
starting from already made PAT-tuples, run the analysis code
that applieas ALL selections, builds di-boson resonances (informally 
called "EDBR")and writes the collections in a cmgTuple (edm-tuple with 
objects belinging to the CMG data format).



=== INPUTS and STEERING ===

*) the main cfg is ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/prod/EDBR_main_cfg.py

*) the file ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/cmdLine.py contains some
steering parameters used by EDBR_main_cfg.py for deciding what to run and
how. They can be changed via command line giving more flexibility 
to the system.

*) the PU-rew histograms are in ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/data/
and they are used in ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/PUweights_cff.py

*) many collections of objects are created: electrons, muons, jets at
different stage of selection, similar thing for V bosons and for EDBR
candidates. A full list with explanation of meanings and location of
files where they are created is in
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/doc/Summary_Collections.pdf

*) the collections of objects saved in the final cmgTuple are specified
in ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/outputModules_cff.py


=== RUNNING ===


1) Prepare a list of input PAT-tuples following the example of
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/datasets/test_RSGZZ600_cff.py

and copy it in the directory ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/datasets/

2) Specify output contents and output file name in outputModules_cff.py

3) make it run:  

cd prod/
cmsRun EDBR_main_cfg.py

4) you can steer from command line several options. 
For example you can switch from a file list to another in this way :
cmsRun EDBR_main_cfg.py infile="newFileList_cff"

If you want to run on dat instead of MC:
cmsRun EDBR_main_cfg.py mcordata=DATA

If you want to store only certain products:
cmsRun EDBR_main_cfg.py content=gen
(for knowing what are the possibilities and what they are 
actually doing, look in ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/outputModules_cff.py)

You can change many options at the same time
cmsRun EDBR_main_cfg.py maxEvents=1234 infile="newFileList_cff" selection="presel" mcordata=DATA json="jsonOfToday.json"

A full list of options allowed is in 
ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/python/cmdLine.py 
FWCore/ParameterSet/python/VarParsing.py
