For plotting macros:
1. Edit EDBRHistoMaker.h for cuts and binning
2. Edit loopPlot.C for options
3. run
root -l -b loopPlot.C++


For optimization of nsubjetness
1. Edit OptimizationMaker.h for cuts
2. Edit optimizer.C for Options
3. Edit ROCcurves.C fpr the percent for masswindow. Default double masswindow = 0.15;
4. run
root -l -b optimizer.C++
root -l -b ROCcurves.C


For signal efficiency
1. Edit absolute_eff.C, change inputpath and isZZChannel
2. run
root -l -b absolute_eff.C
3. Find the plots of 6 categories and efficiencies_MCSig.txt in SignalEffPlots/




For closure test
1. create trees after cuts
go to ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/test
Edit the options in createTreesClosureTest_xww.C
and run with 
root -l -b createTreesClosureTest_xww.C++
2. go to ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRCommon/test/fits
Edit options in fitSidebands.cpp
Edit options in fitBackground.cpp
and run with
make fitSidebands
./fitSidebands
make fitBackground
./fitBackground
3. For results look at mZZ_alpha_1JHP_MU_Madgraph_ROOFIT.eps and fitPlot_1J_HP_MU_log.eps
